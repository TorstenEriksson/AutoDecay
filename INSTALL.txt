INSTALL AutoDecay 5.

* clone the AutoDecay repository
* The following files are important:
	AD.pl             -  The AutoDecay program
	AD.def            -  Settings file containing defaults
	HelpText.txt      -  Info on how to run AutoDecay
	
Note: You may want to move the defaults file to your home directory:
mv AD.def ~/.AutoDecay

* Check that AD.pl is executable by you
* Adjust $PATH if need be or copy AD.pl to a directory which is in your path.
* If your perl executables don't reside in /usr/bin you'll have to modify
  the first line of AutoDecay accordingly.
* Read the HelpText.

MOVING TEXT FILES BETWEEN PLATFORMS
Windows still use the archaic form of text file line endings: CR+LF. Unix 
uses LF and so does Mac OS X these days. The problem with line endings
inevitably causes problems when you move files between systems because Perl
needs text files with native line endings. You can change them by opening
the file in an editor such as PAUP's own text editor and "save as...". Before
saving, make sure to change file type. 

Another way (on unix) is to open a terminal and use the "tr" command.

Change a Mac Classic file into a unix file:
tr "\r" "\n" <file_name >new_file_name
Change a mac Classic file into a Windows file:
tr "\r" "\r\n" <file_name >new_file_name
Change a Windows file into a unix file:
tr -d "\r" <file_name > new_file_name
