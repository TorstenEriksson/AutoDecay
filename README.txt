AutoDecay is a small utility for creating clade decay values (a.k.a. Bremer
support, branch support, you name it) with PAUP* doing almost all of the work.
AutoDecay is written in Perl (http://www.perl.com) an open source programming
language that runs on most platforms.

Before making this software available on GitHub, the last version released was 5.06,
and this was the version in the initial commit.
Now, the only way to obtain AutoDecay is from this repository. Sorry: no support.

Version 5.0 differs from previous versions of AutoDecay:
* Designed to use PAUP* 4.0. Older versions of PAUP may not work.
* Invoked from the command line.
* Minor changes in internal file format.
* Uses shorthand version of constraint trees.
* Defaults for PAUP* runs are read from settings file.
* Any of the tree, adc or log files can be input for the extraction 
* No multiple command files.
* No scaling of weights
